# What is Secret?
Secret Network is the first blockchain with privacy-preserving smart contracts. That means applications built on Secret can utilize encrypted data without revealing it to anyone, even the nodes in the network. For the first time, Secret Network allows developers to build powerful, permissionless, privacy-preserving applications - Secret Apps.
Secret Apps - powered by “secret”, privacy-preserving smart contracts - are built with CosmWasm smart contracts that are written in the Rust programming language and deployed on the Secret Network.
The Secret Network blockchain itself is based on Cosmos SDK / Tendermint, meaning the network has its own independent consensus, on-chain governance, and features like slashing and delegation. 

# Why build on Secret?
 Secret Network combines the best features of decentralized, open-source networks, and blockchains with the benefits of data privacy and improved usability. These improvements are critical for achieving mass adoption. 
Developers can enjoy the benefits of smart contracts and DApps: they are robust, unstoppable, censor-resistant, and transparent. But blockchains, and by extension smart contracts have one glaring problem that is often overlooked - all data stored on them is public. In that sense, blockchains are worse than existing Web 2 solutions when it comes to privacy. 
Instead of trusting your data with a single organization, you now have to trust everyone. Secret contracts and Secret Apps combine these benefits of DApps but add the ability to keep data private, helping remove one of the biggest barriers to mass adoption of the decentralized web. 

 # What can you build on Secret?
 As the first blockchain to support encrypted inputs, encrypted outputs, and encrypted state for smart contracts, Secret Network allows for new kinds of powerful decentralized applications to be built. This can unlock substantial value across multiple verticals and industries, including the following:
 - Decentralized Finance: Support for privacy-preserving asset transfers, lending, and more
 - Data sharing: Sharing and monetizing data while keeping it secure
 - Machine learning: Discovering powerful insights while protecting underlying data
 - Healthcare: Allowing research over encrypted data, driving innovation
 - Gaming Industry: Enabling more open and more usable gaming experiences
